        "In SVM:\n",

        "* **Linear Kernel** – for linearly separable data\n",
        "* **Polynomial Kernel** – captures polynomial relationships\n",
        "* **Radial Basis Function (RBF/Gaussian)** – handles complex, non-linear boundaries\n",

        "Answer-  The **Naïve Bayes classifier** is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** based on **Bayes’ Theorem** and is mainly used for **classification tasks**.\n",
        "\n",
        "It calculates the probability that a data point belongs to a particular class given its features, and then assigns the class with the **highest posterior probability**.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is called **“Naïve”** because it makes a **strong simplifying assumption** that **all features are independent of each other**, given the class label.\n",
